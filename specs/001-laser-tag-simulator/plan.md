# Implementation Plan: Laser Tag Simulator

**Branch**: `001-laser-tag-simulator` | **Date**: 2025-12-09 | **Spec**: [spec.md](D:\Documents\Code Project\GOTF-emulator\specs\001-laser-tag-simulator\spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-laser-tag-simulator/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a Windows Forms (WinForms) application to serve as a test harness for the `GOTF-laser-tag` system. The simulator will generate and send HTTP POST requests for both the `/match` and `/prop` endpoints, emulating the data sent by the laser tag host and a physical bomb prop. This allows for comprehensive testing without requiring the actual hardware.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: C# / .NET 9.0
**Primary Dependencies**: Windows Forms (WinForms), System.Text.Json, HttpClient
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Compilation Only
**Target Platform**: Windows 10/11
**Project Type**: Standalone Desktop Application
**Performance Goals**: UI must remain responsive. HTTP heartbeats should be sent at the configured interval (+/- 20ms).
**Constraints**: Must use .NET 9 and WinForms as specified. Must serialize JSON with camelCase naming.
**Scale/Scope**: The simulator will support up to 10 players per team as a baseline.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [X] **Technology Stack**: Is the proposed solution using C# and .NET 9.0? (Yes, the plan adheres to the C# / .NET 9.0 stack.)
- [X] **Verification**: Does the plan rely only on compilation for verification? (Yes, no automated tests are planned.)
- [X] **Modularity**: Is the proposed project structure modular? (Yes, the design will separate UI, data models, and services.)

    ├── MainForm.cs          # Main application form logic
    ├── MainForm.Designer.cs # UI layout generated by WinForms designer

    └── services/
        ├── MatchSimulatorService.cs # Handles the /match heartbeat logic
        └── PropSimulatorService.cs  # Handles the /prop heartbeat logic
```

**Structure Decision**: A single project structure is chosen for simplicity, as this is a standalone desktop application. The logic for each simulator (match and prop) will be separated into its own service class to maintain modularity.
