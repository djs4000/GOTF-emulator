# Research: Enhanced Match Emulation with Countdown

**Date**: 2025-12-09
**Input**: [Implementation Plan](plan.md)

## Summary

This document confirms the technology choices for enhancing match emulation with countdown and state management. All technical decisions are based on the existing, established architecture of the application (C#/.NET 9.0, WinForms). No new external technologies, libraries, or complex patterns are being introduced that would require dedicated research. The focus is on implementing state management and timer logic within the existing framework.
